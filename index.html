                    Hi there, I'm Andrew! I am currently a student at UC Berkeley studying Electrical Engineering
                    and Computer Science. My interests are in computer security and distributed systems, financial
                    markets, and in computer science education.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This semester, I am a Junior Mentor for CS 61A, Berkeley's largest introductory computer science
                    class, as a part of <a href="https://csmentors.berkeley.edu/" target = "_blank">Computer Science
                    Mentors</a>. I'm also a member of <a href="http://www.calakpsi.com/" target = "_blank">Alpha
                    Kappa Psi</a>, where I've picked up some  knowledge of investment banking, consulting, and
                    trading.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside of schoolwork, in my free time I like to play tennis, go hiking, online window shop for
                    new clothes, and attempt to cook. My friends have also recently introduced me to rock climbing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm currently looking for summer 2020 software engineering internships. In the past, I interned
                    at <a href="https://www.varmour.com/" target="_blank">vArmour</a> on their orchestration team,
                    but I'm open to both backend and full-stack positions. Check out my
                    <a href="assets/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and please let me know if you know of any
                    interesting opportunities!
                </p>

                <p>
