                    Hi there! I'm Andrew. I'm a sophomore studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the
                    University of California, Berkeley. I'm passionate about education and using tech to make the
                    world a better place. In my free time, I like to play tennis, go hiking, online shop (mostly for
                    clothes), and attempt to cook.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm currently looking for for summer 2020 software engineering internships. My previous experience has
                    had a strong focus in backend development but I've explored full-stack development with some personal
                    projects. Check out my <a href="assets/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> and please let me know
                    if you might know of any interesting opportunities!
                </p>

                <p>
